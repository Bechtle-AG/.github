## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs or repositories, search if an [issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). 
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. 
As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
